Features:
* Connected/Disconnected: Rather than the connection options being disabled from the user, they may freely connect or disconnect. When connected to a server the button will only allow disconnect. Inversely, when not connected, the button will only allow for connecting. 

* Surprise! The surprise! button is a special feature we implemented. When clicked it will change the entire map and all assets to a winter theme! Click the button again to go back to the original theme.

* Hats: use the hat selector on the menu bar to choose between 9 unique hats to put on all the snakes.

* Snakes: 
o There are 8 unique snake colors a map may have before a color is replicated. 
o The view is centered on your snake.
o If you disconnect, your snake is gone, and on reconnecting you will get a new snake.
o Upon death, a death animation will occur showing your snake blown apart!
o Each snake's name and score will appear above their head

*Power-ups:
o While we have two different power-up designs, they both do the same thing: elongating the snake.
